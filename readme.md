[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swergroup/uploadplus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swergroup/uploadplus) [![Flattr this!](https://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=swergroup&url=http://wordpress.org/plugins/uploadplus/&title=UploadPlus%20WP%20plugin)

Filenames on the web are different than those on the desktop. Empty spaces and strange characters doesn't belong to web space.
Enter UploadPlus: you can set your rules and clean your files' name while they upload. Three basic rules:

* convert spaces and strange characters into dashes (-)
* only alphanumeric [A-Za-z] and digits, spaces and strange characters stripped out;
* convert spaces and strange characters in underscores (_)

You can apply website-based or date-based prefix, even a custom prefix. Lowercase or Uppercase? Your choice!
