Security and sanity in file names while uploading.

== Description ==

If you are building a site for clients based on WordPress, you want to make it as easy for them as possible to enter information without having to consider coding and other issues. This plugin is great for those types of sites, as well as for anyone with a WordPress site who wants to have one less thing to think about. 

In the plugin settings page you can preview what transformation will apply without even uploading a file. Also, 2.5 version ships with transliteration to utf8 characters, thanks to [phputf8](http://phputf8.sourceforge.net/) opensource PHP classes.

This is how the plugin works: when a file is selected for uploading, this plugin changes the filename according to the following three rules:

* convert spaces and strange characters into dashes (-)
* only alphanumeric [A-Za-z] and digits, spaces and strange characters stripped out;
* convert spaces and strange characters in underscores (_)

You can also choose to make file names lowercase or keep uppercase characters, or add a date/unique/custom prefix.
Actual prefix allowed:

* day (dd_)
* month/day	(mmdd_)
* year/month/day (yyyymmdd_)
* year/month/day/hour/minutes (yyyymmddhhmm_)
* year/month/day/hour/minutes/seconds (yyyymmddhhmmss_)
* random (mt-rand)
* unix timestamp
* ...
