Filenames on the web are different than those on the desktop. Empty spaces and strange characters doesn't belong to web space.
Enter UploadPlus: you can set your rules and clean your files' name while they upload. Three basic rules:

* convert spaces and strange characters into dashes (-)
* only alphanumeric [A-Za-z] and digits, spaces and strange characters stripped out;
* convert spaces and strange characters in underscores (_)

You can apply website-based or date-based prefix, even a custom prefix. Lowercase or Uppercase? Your choice!
