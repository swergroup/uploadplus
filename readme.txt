== Description ==

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swergroup/uploadplus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swergroup/uploadplus)

Filenames on the web are different than those on the desktop. Empty spaces and strange characters doesn't belong to web space.
Enter UploadPlus: you can set your rules and clean your files' name while they upload. Three basic rules:

* convert spaces and strange characters into dashes (-)
* only alphanumeric [A-Za-z] and digits, spaces and strange characters stripped out;
* convert spaces and strange characters in underscores (_)

You can apply website-based or date-based prefix, even a custom prefix. Lowercase or Uppercase? Your choice! 
Some default prefix:

* day (dd_)
* month/day	(mmdd_)
* year/month/day (yyyymmdd_)
* year/month/day/hour/minutes (yyyymmddhhmm_)
* year/month/day/hour/minutes/seconds (yyyymmddhhmmss_)
* random (mt-rand)
* unix timestamp
* and many more!

UploadPlus can also transliterate filenames. You can preview settings in the media settings page without uploading files.
